# AI4EOweek4
This repository contains the Week 4 assignment for GEOL0069: Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation, focusing on the application of unsupervised learning methods to satellite altimetry data. The primary objective is to classify Sentinel-3 altimetry waveforms and distinguish between sea ice and leads.

The work builds upon the provided notebook Unit_2_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods.ipynb, extending it through feature engineering, clustering analysis, and waveform interpretation.
